2. Basic scan:

A basic scan in Nessus typically involves scanning the identified hosts for common vulnerabilities using a predefined set of plugins.
Basic scans provide a quick overview of the security posture of the scanned hosts but may not detect more sophisticated or less common vulnerabilities.

3. Advanced scan:

An advanced scan in Nessus involves a more comprehensive and in-depth examination of the target hosts. 
It often includes additional checks beyond the basic scan, such as credentialed scans
Compliance checks against specific security standards or configurations, and more extensive vulnerability checks using a wider range of plugins.
Advanced scans are useful for organizations that require a more thorough assessment of their security posture and want to identify a broader range of vulnerabilities.
