3. Using search

    Search option is used to search the incident log with time span.

    Limiting a search by time is a key to faster result and is a best pratice.
    Eg. Installing cmatrix in remote VM (Kali) and we can see the installation logs in splunk enterprises.

  Commands that create statics and visualisation are called transforming commands.
  We can share the share job log with other user it will remian active for 7 days, and every 10 min we need to refresh the log search.
  We can dowload the report in csv,xml,json.

4. Exploring Events

   If we search the objects in filters by default the event will turn the list, filtered keyword would be highlighted and we can examine the logs with timespan.

  Many events actions filter will be available.

5. Using search term

   search terms are not case senstive and booleans also we can use
   Boolean operations have an order of evaluation a. NOT b. OR c. AND Note: parenthesis () should be used

7. What are knowledge objects?
   It is tools that help you discover and analyse the data, will be grouped in 5 categories .
    a.Data Interpretation b.Data classifications c.Data Enrichment d.Data Normalisation e.Data Model
   Knowleage object is use full for several reasons it can be create by one user and share with other user with permission granted. It is powerful tool for your       deployment
   Data Interpretation - Fields
