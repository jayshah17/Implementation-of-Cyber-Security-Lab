## 1. Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.

Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that enables electronic devices to connect to a wireless local area network (WLAN), typically using the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands.

### Basic Working of Wi-Fi:

1. **Radio Signals**: Wi-Fi works by transmitting data over radio waves. Devices such as computers, smartphones, and routers communicate by sending and receiving these radio signals.

2. **Access Points (APs)**: Wireless routers or access points act as the central hub for Wi-Fi connections. They receive data from connected devices and transmit it to other devices on the network and vice versa.

3. **Network Identification**: Wi-Fi networks are identified by their Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is essentially the network name. Devices scan for nearby SSIDs and connect to the desired network.

4. **Authentication and Encryption**: Once a device connects to a Wi-Fi network, it typically undergoes an authentication process to verify its identity. Encryption protocols such as WPA2 or WPA3 are used to secure data transmission over the network.

### Types of Wi-Fi:

1. **802.11b/g/n**: These are older Wi-Fi standards operating primarily in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. They offer relatively slower speeds compared to newer standards.

2. **802.11ac**: Also known as Wi-Fi 5, this standard operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, providing faster speeds and improved performance compared to older standards.

3. **802.11ax**: Also referred to as Wi-Fi 6, this is the latest Wi-Fi standard offering even higher speeds, lower latency, and improved efficiency, especially in high-density environments.

### Types of Wi-Fi Attacks:

1. **Eavesdropping (Passive Attacks)**: Attackers can intercept Wi-Fi signals to capture sensitive information such as passwords or financial data without actively engaging with the network.

2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: In this type of attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially altering or eavesdropping on the data being transmitted.

3. **Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers attempt to crack Wi-Fi passwords by systematically trying all possible combinations until they find the correct one.

4. **Evil Twin Attacks**: Attackers set up rogue access points with the same SSID as a legitimate network, tricking users into connecting to it and potentially exposing their data.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Attackers flood a Wi-Fi network with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

6. **WPS Vulnerabilities**: Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature that simplifies the process of connecting devices to a Wi-Fi network, but it can also introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly configured, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.

These are just a few examples of the types of attacks that can target Wi-Fi networks. Implementing strong encryption, regularly updating firmware, and using strong, unique passwords are essential practices to mitigate these threats.

## 2. Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet.

## 3. Create an Access point with any Wi-Fi encryption standard and start testing the security of that connection using any Wi-Fi security testing tools, which should include (Aircrack-Ng, Wifite, not limited). Try to capture the 4-way handshake using these methods.
